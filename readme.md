# Realtime HTML5 Editor

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4085b6bc-dac4-4a8f-8461-257959afa407/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/realtime-html-editor/deploys)

This is a simple real-time html editor, for very small tests and things like this with html/css/javascript. It was maded just for fun, to test some functionalities of html elements, libraries like [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) (which was used to make the writing zone) and fulfill my need to make a 'home-made' tool for fast html test.

**[Live Edition here](https://realtime-html-editor.netlify.com/)**

## Features:

- Code highlight;
- Auto-close tags and brackets;
- Real-time code rendering;
- Some features will be added in the future :-P
